Data Science<br>

A/PURPOSE:<br>
In this project, I analyzed the most popular songs on Spotify from the last decade (2010-2019) and visualized their music elements and genre to see how they trend over the years. I also looked at the popular artists on Spotify who won the American Music Award for every year. <br>

In this dashboard you will be able to:<br>
Select any year from 2010-2019 and see a/The top 10 most popular songs and artists on Spotify, and b/Spotify artists (if any) who won the American Music Award. <br>
Select an artist name and see their popular songs on Spotify.<br>
Select a song to see its elements/attributes.<br>
Select song attributes to see how their trend over the years.<br>
See the top 3 music trends in the past decade.<br>

B/ DATASOURES & INSTRUCTION:<br>
You will need to import 2 .csv files (both attached in the project):<br>
'Spotify-2000.csv','to_match_youtube2.csv'<br>

You can choose to run one of the 2 files below:<br>
The pluu_maincode.py is the Python file.<br>
The Phung-Luu-Shopify-Final-May (1).ipynb is the Jupyter Notebook file. <br>

Step 4: Preparing differents tables and lists that will be used in visualizations later. <br>
Step 5: Creating a Dash layout and inserting components.<br>
Step 6: Creating callbacks using inputs and outputs.<br>
Step 7: Formating the location, layout and appearance of all charts.<br>
Step 8: Testing and Publishing.<br>

Please let me know if you have any questions. Your class is the best! Thank you!<br>

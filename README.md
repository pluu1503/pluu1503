- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Phung Luu

MA 705, Professor Luke Cherveny
Data Science

In this project, I analyze the most popular songs on Spotify from the last decade (2010-2019) and visualized their music elements and genre to see how they trend over the years. I also looked at the popular artists on Spoitfy who won the American Music Award for every year. 

In this dashboard you will be able to:
Select any year from 2010-2019 and see a/The top 10 most popular songs and artists on Spotify, and b/Spotify artists (if any) who won the American Music Award. 
Select an artist name and see their popular songs on Spotify.
Select a song to see its elements/attributes.
Select song attributes to see how their trend over the years.
See the top 3 music trends in the past decade.

You will need to import 2 .csv files (both attached in the project):
'Spotify-2000.csv','to_match_youtube2.csv'

You can choose to run one of the 2 files below:
The pluu_maincode.py is the Python file.
The Phung-Luu-Shopify-Final-May (1).ipynb is the Jupyter Notebook file.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Your class is the best! Thank you!

Enjoy!
Phung Luu
